# PBASIC-projects
Collection of projects for the Parallax BASIC Stamp microcontroller

This is a series of projects I completed for a college class on microprocessors. All programs in this repository were programmed in PBASIC using the BASIC Stamp Editor that can be downloaded here: https://www.parallax.com/downloads/basic-stamp-software

PBASIC is a slightly modified version of the BASIC language for Parallax microcontrollers. The main challenge of these projects was to design a responsive system on a microcontroller with limited capabilities. These projects incorperated a wide variety of electronic components including LEDs, servos, 555 timers, potentiometers, 7-segment displays, etc.

Each project uses components from the Parallax BASIC Stamp Activity kit that can be found here: https://www.parallax.com/product/90005

I hope you find these interesting!
