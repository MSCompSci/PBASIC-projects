# PBASIC-projects
## Collection of projects for the Parallax BASIC Stamp microcontroller

This is a series of projects I completed for a college class on microprocessors. All programs in this repository were programmed in PBASIC using the BASIC Stamp Editor. These projects expanded on the concepts introduced in Version 3.0 of *What's a Microcontroller?* by Andy Lindsay as included in the Basic Stamp kit.

PBASIC is a slightly modified version of the BASIC language for Parallax microcontrollers. The main challenge of these projects was to design a responsive system on a microcontroller with limited capabilities. These projects incorperated a wide variety of electronic components including LEDs, servos, 555 timers, potentiometers, 7-segment displays, etc.

Each project uses components from the Parallax BASIC Stamp Activity kit, but some may require larger amounts of certain components than provided in the kit.

I hope you find these interesting!

## Summary

- Project 1 creates a light show with different patterns using various color LEDs.

- Project 2 simulates a basic U.S. 4-way traffic light with protected left turns using LEDs.

- Project 3 models an entry gate with three buttons that must be pressed in the correct order to open the gate using a servo. The system also incorperates three LEDs that display the status of the gate system when it is closed, about to open or close, and when it is fully open.

- Project 4 is an expansion of Project 2 which adds two crosswalks and their cooresponding pushbuttons to the traffic flow order.

- Project 5 uses a potentiometer to control the RC time measured by the BASIC Stamp. This RC time is then used to control the position of a servo, display a number 0-9 on a seven-segment display, and blink an LED at a variable rate relative to the displayed number and servo position.

- Project 6 simulates a common windsheild wiper control system with intermittent, medium, and fast settings.

- Project 7 Pt 1 and Pt 2 use a pushbutton and seven-segment display to randomly generate a number while the button is pressed. Pt 1 cycles through numbers on the seven-segment display while the button is pressed, and Pt 2 cycles through numbers on the seven-segment display for 12 seconds after the button is pressed.
